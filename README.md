# Scorchy

Scorchy is a thick (opposed to 'thin' Silverlight&trade; version) graphical user interface for System Center Orchestrator 2012 R2&reg; by [Microsoft](https://microsoft.com).
### Key features
- Able to execute runbooks against multiple sets of data (allows execution of repeatable tasks)
- Able to copy-paste from all of the fields
- Allows to search for particular runbook by simply typing it's name
- Able to show who executed particular runbook, and when. Uses ADDS domain controller to resolve SIDs to logon names

You need to provide Orchestrator Webservice URL (like http://orchhost:81/orchestrator2012/orchestrator.svc/) in settings dialog.
